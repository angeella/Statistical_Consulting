# Statistical Consulting Project

Add here some ideas :) 

1. Only confirmed cases from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/who_covid_19_situation_reports;
2. Hospital bed as variable from OECD (data folder);
3. Reference lockdown across states: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_responses_to_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic
