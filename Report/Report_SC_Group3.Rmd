## Introduction 

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, policy makers in different countries have introduced different political actions to contrast
the contagion. The containment restrictions span from worldwide curfews, stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns/lockdowns to softer measures and stay-at-home recommendations and including in addition the development of contact tracing strategies and specific testing policies.
The pandemic has resulted in the largest amount of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the same time in history.

The timing of the different interventions with respect to the spread of the contagion both at a global and intra-national level has been very different from country to country. This, in combination with demographical, economic, health-care related and area-specific factors, have resulted in different contagion patterns across the world.


Therefore, our goal is two-fold. The aim is to measure the effect of the different political actions by analysing and comparing types of actions from a global perspective and, at the same time, to benchmark the effect of the same action in an heterogeneous framework such as the Italian regional context.

In doing so, some issue arises concerning the identification and codification of the different measures undertaken by governments, the analysis related to whether a strategies resemblance can be detected across countries.
